# GoHFS
Golang implementation of simple HTTP server with upload feature.  

![](ss.png)

This application is intended to replace python built-in module simple HTTP server.  
Therefore, there won't be any significant changes to the code.  
If you want to use more feature-rich application, I suggest [pwndrop](https://github.com/kgretzky/pwndrop).  
To get started with this app, simply download the binary in the `releases` folder.  
  
You can also follow like so,
```
wget -O gohfs https://git.finzzz.net/gohfs
chmod +x gohfs
./gohfs
```
  
Getting help
```
./gohfs -h
```
